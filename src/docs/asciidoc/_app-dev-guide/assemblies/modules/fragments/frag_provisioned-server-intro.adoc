Bootable jar is only included in hello world servlet application as of now.
Therefore, information related to bootable jar is included inside ifeval, which checks whether the artifact id matches that of the hello world servlet.

Instead of deploying your applications to an existing {ProductShortName} server distribution, you can provision a {ProductShortName} server to deploy and run an application by using the {ProductShortName} Maven plug-in. The following procedure demonstrates configuring and using the {ProductShortName} Maven plug-in.

ifeval::["{artifactID}" == "helloworld"]
There are two ways to package an application in the provisioned 
server:

* Provision the server with the application deployed in the `target/server` directory. This is similar to the standard application deployment. In this procedure, the "provisioned-server" profile is used for this kind of packaging.

* Alternatively, you can package the server with the application deployed as an executable Java Archive (jar). In this case you cannot easily change the application as it is within a jar file. However, you can start the server with the application deployed by simply using the `java -jar` command. In this procedure, the "bootable-jar" profile is used for this kind of packaging.
