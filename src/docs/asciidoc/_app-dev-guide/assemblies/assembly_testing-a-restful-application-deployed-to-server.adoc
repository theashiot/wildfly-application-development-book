To ensure that the RESTful application deployed on {ProductShortName} is working, you can add integration tests.

To add tests for an application deployed on a {ProductShortName} server running on bare metal, follow these procedures:

* xref:adding-the-maven-dependencies-required-for-junit-tests-rs_testing-an-application-deployed-to-server[Adding the Maven dependencies and profile required for integration tests]
* xref:creating-a-test-class-to-test-the-hello-world-restful-service_testing-an-application-deployed-to-server[Creating a test class to test the hello world RESTful service]
* xref:testing-a-restful-application-deployed-on-wildfly-that-is-running-on-bare-metal_testing-an-application-deployed-to-server[Testing a RESTful application deployed on {ProductShortName} that is running on bare metal]

To add tests for an application deployed on a provisioned {ProductShortName} server, follow these procedures:

* xref:adding-the-maven-dependencies-required-for-junit-tests-rs_testing-an-application-deployed-to-server[Adding the Maven dependencies and profile required for integration tests]
* xref:creating-a-test-class-to-test-the-hello-world-restful-service_testing-an-application-deployed-to-server[Creating a test class to test the hello world RESTful service]

To add tests for an application deployed on a {ProductShortName} server running on {cloudPlatform}, follow these procedures:

* xref:adding-the-maven-dependencies-required-for-junit-tests-rs_testing-an-application-deployed-to-server[Adding the Maven dependencies and profile required for integration tests]
